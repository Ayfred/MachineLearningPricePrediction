User Guide to Run Jupyter Notebook
This guide presents the necessary steps to execute the Jupyter Notebook provided in this directory.

Prerequisites
Have a version of Python installed on your machine
Have selected a Jupyter environment
Installation of necessary packages
To run the notebook, it is necessary to install certain Python packages. You can do this using the following commands:

pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
pip install xgboost

Executing the notebook
Once the packages are installed, you can run the notebook by opening the file Projet_Machine_Learning.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Predicting Data
If you wish to predict data, you can run the file Projet_Machine_Learning_trained_models.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

We have saved our two most performant models (one for regression and one for classification).

You can enter house features in two different ways:

If you want to predict the price of a single house, you can fill in the necessary characteristics of that house in the np.array of the cells associated with the models.

If you want to predict the price of multiple houses, you can fill in the data_to_predict.csv file in the data folder, then run the cells associated with the models.

A data_description.txt file is available to help you select characteristic values to estimate the price of your house(s).

Happy predictions!
